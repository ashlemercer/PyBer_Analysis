# PyBer_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
For this assignment we used Python and Pands to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city types, and then created a graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

### Results

From this data we can see that Urban areas have the highest number of drivers, rides, and total fares, followed by suburban, and then rural. Rural has the highest average fare per ride and driver, which shows that the rides are either longer because drivers are having to come from the city, or are more expensive due to the lower amount of drivers. This could be remedied by adding more drivers to rural areas.
